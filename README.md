# CLI Project Management Tool (Name TBC)
**Status**: W.I.P.

## Description
I've created this program because I wanted a slick way to keep track of my coding project tasks directly from VSCode and decided that the terminal would be a nice way to do it. I chose C++ as I have some familiarity with it and also wanted to use this project to develop my understand of software development with C++.

The program will have basic functionality:
- Project task and note lists
- Ability to add, modify, delete and complete tasks and notes
- Ability to add a "last action message" that will help to remind of the last action(s) taken the last time the project was worked on

## Project information
I am using TDD to develop this program: a desired feature is decided and its usage (i.e. the way the functions are called in the code) is preliminarily decided, then unit-tests are written and code is written to pass the tests. Code is then refactored. Doctest is used for testing, header file is included in the tests folder (doctest.h).
