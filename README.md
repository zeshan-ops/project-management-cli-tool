Projecto is a command line interface tool for managing coding projects; like a very simple and stripped back [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior). Each project consists of a log, tasks and notes. Tasks, notes and log items can be added, edited and deleted and there are different views that can be output to the terminal.
