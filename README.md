# CLI Project Management Tool (Name TBC)
**Status**: W.I.P.

## Description
I've created this program because I wanted a slick way to keep track of my coding project tasks directly from VSCode and decided that the terminal would be a nice way to do it. I chose C++ as I have some familiarity with it and also wanted to use this project to develop my understand of software development with C++.

The program will have basic functionality:
- Separation of tasks via project
- Ability to add, modify, delete and complete tasks
- Ability to filter tasks by urgency, due date or project
- Ability to add a "last action message" that will help to remind of that last actions taken the last time the project was worked on
