Projecto is a command line interface tool for managing coding projects; like a very simple and stripped back [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior). Each project consists of tasks and logs. Tasks can be added, edited and deleted, logs can be added and deleted and there are different views that can be output to the terminal.
