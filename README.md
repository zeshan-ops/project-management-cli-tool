# Projecto
Command line coding project management tool

**Status**: W.I.P.

## Description
I've created this program because I wanted a slick way to keep track of my coding project tasks directly from VSCode and decided that the terminal would be a nice way to do it. I chose C++ as I have some familiarity with it and also wanted to use this project to develop my understand of software development with C++.

The program will have basic functionality:
- Project task and note lists
- Ability to add, modify, delete and complete tasks and notes
- Ability to add a "last action message" that will help to remind of the last action(s) taken the last time the project was worked on

***Current Features***:
- Add, delete and edit tasks
- Add, delete and edit notes
- Edit last action taken on project

## Project information
I am using TDD to develop this program: a desired feature is decided and its usage (i.e. the way the functions are called in the code) is preliminarily decided, then unit-tests are written and code is written to pass the tests. Code is then refactored. [Doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) is used for testing, the header file is included in the tests folder (doctest.h).
