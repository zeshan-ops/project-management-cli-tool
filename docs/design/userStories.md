# User Stories
Projecto is aimed at helping manage hobby coding projects. Since I am designing this for personal use, the user stories will center around my need cases for now.

- I want to have an overview of my project that can show its tasks and a log of actions so that I can easily keep track of my coding exploits.
- I want to be able to quickly add, edit and delete tasks and quickly add, view and delete log entries.
- I want to be able to store multiple projects and access them in such a manner that calling Projecto shows a specific project unless the focused project is changed (i.e., everytime projecto is called, it shows the same project it showed last time unless told otherwise) so that calling projecto is not unecessarily burdensome.
- I want the terminal output to be aesthetically pleasing so that I enjoy using the tool.
- I want to be able to easily extend the properties of tasks and log entries in the codebase in the future if so desired.
